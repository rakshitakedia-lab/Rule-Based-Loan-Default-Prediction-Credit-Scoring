## **Rule-Based Loan Default Prediction & Credit Scoring**

### **Project Overview**

This Python project evaluates a borrower’s creditworthiness based on financial and credit profile metrics. It calculates a credit score, estimates probability of default (PD), and provides a lending recommendation without relying on machine learning models. Designed to be interactive and explainable, this project demonstrates a practical approach to credit risk assessment in banking.

### **Key Features**

- Credit Scoring: Uses CIBIL score, income, debt ratios, credit utilization, employment length, age, and past delinquencies.
- Probability of Default (PD): Converts the credit score into a risk probability using a sigmoid function.
- Risk Categorization: Classifies borrowers as Low, Medium, or High Risk with actionable recommendations.
- Explainable Results: Breaks down how each factor contributes to the final credit score.
- Interactive CLI: Users enter borrower details and receive instant assessment.
